"Astaria has been at the forefront of technological advance, putting it permanently in the history books as one of the most important cities ever founded.

Over the years, Astaria has developed in many sectors, but most of all Artificial Intelligence. Ever heard of StellaRing? That AI company was founded in Astaria!

For those readers who are unfamiliar with StellaRing, they are a manufacturing firm dealing around creating Artificial Intelligence devices. Most of what you use is made by them. Phones, TVs, cars... So much is made by this one company. They have workforces all across the globe, but their HQ is in Astaria itself.

Now, onto the point of this article. Astaria is in the spotlight once more. StellaRing has reported they are working on creating humanoid Androids. They're the first to attempt it since the Techno War back in 12943. Can you believe that was over 100 years ago now? The public's reaction was mixed, of course, but everyone was collectively certain the Ferradain Government would not allow this. However, to everyone's surprise, they did!

The Head of Government, Mrs. Klara Tangho, spoke on this issue this morning. She said the following:

"I understand our citizens are worried about this decision, and I can assure you your concerns have been heard. These Androids will be heavily monitored, both in production and after final assembly, to make sure they are safe."

Do you believe her? I cannot say.

Anyways, how exciting! Surely something good will come from this. We hope, anyways.

That's all for now! Thanks for reading, everyone! Have a great night!!"
